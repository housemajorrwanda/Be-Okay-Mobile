# Be-Okay

## AI-Enabled Digital Health Platform

### Project Description

Be-Okay is an AI-enabled digital health platform that provides simple and quick medical checkups and follow-ups on outpatient treatments. Accessible in real-time via mobile devices, Be-Okay offers reliable health services, especially for emergencies, disease tracking, and addressing the shortage of medical professionals.

### Our Model

- Patient Data Management: Be-Okay stores data for users and their family dependents, updates users on their health status, and integrates with hospital systems to share data with health practitioners.
AI-Driven Health Insights: The AI model retrieves patient data, including allergies, addictions, and medical history. This data is combined with symptoms and vital signs to predict cases and suggest quick response options, nearby hospitals, and specialists.
- Family Health Tracking: Be-Okay tracks hereditary and infectious diseases by merging data of users and their dependents.
- Doctor Profile and Recommendations: The platform saves doctor profiles (bio, experience, service rating, specialization) and suggests doctors to patients based on diagnosis. Patients can choose doctors for consultations.
### Features

- Doctor Homepage: Displays patient requests and a calendar.
- Real-time Messaging: Includes features for voice notes, audio, and video calls.
- Interactive Body Image: Clickable options for body parts.
- PDF Forms: Convert forms into PDF documents with specific designs.
